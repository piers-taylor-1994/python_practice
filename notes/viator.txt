- You can use a tuple() as a valid key a dictionary
- I also sorted a string and then made it into a tuple() to use as a key in a dictionary -> sorted(tuple(word))

- For Sudoku, (row // 3, col // 3) is a good way of identifying/matching grids

- A set() removes all duplicates upon initialisation
- You can't access items via index in a set, you have to use a loop

- When using a heap, think about what you're doing (in the meeting rooms, we always have to push the current intervals end, but the pop is dependant on logic?)
- Heaps are defaulty min-heaps, use negatives to inverse the logic

- When binary searching over a range, you can split up 2 binary searchs and specify which is left centric or right centric
- You can set a current result, and then let it keep binary searching even after it's found the target to see if there's any others further down

- When tackling linked lists, you can initialise a value (head = ListNode()) before you use another value (tail = head) to venture down lists, to eventually return the result at the beginning (return head/head.next)
- Quite often the tricky part is working out what to return

- To clone a graph / matrix / binary tree, you utilise a dictionary in the form of {original_node: clone_node} -> {node: Node(node.val)} and then use a queue like normal. You then use the cloned values to populate the cloned_nodes.neighbors etc
